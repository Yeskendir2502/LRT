# LRT

We chose ZEP Track and the main target that we are focusing on is the popularization of ZEP among people and the promotion of cafes/entertaining places/shops and so on by using metaverse. 

We called our app Metapromote™ which is a “normal app” that allows building spaces for business promotion. 

Users can ask each other about food/clothes/etc. and make recommendations to know more about new options, also they can complete quests to advance in season pass that rewards them with free coupons from cafeterias. In the quest, users have to make an Instagram post with a unique hashtag, a brand hashtag, and their specific image must include the logo of a specific cafeteria and product.

To achieve our goal and complete tasks we used the following techniques:

* ZEP script for the interaction between players and the metaverse;

* “Selenium” to get an Instagram website with a hashtag tab; 

* “Beautifulsoup” to get information;

* Requests to download the image;

* Image classification model trained on data collected from the web that can classify Starbucks and McDonald's stores and logos as an example. It is used to check quests.


Now we are working on coding stuff and combining all scripts that we are making.
