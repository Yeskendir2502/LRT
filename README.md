We chose ZEP Track and the main target that we are focusing on is the popularization of ZEP among people and the promotion of cafes/entertaining places/shops and so on by using metaverse. 

We called our app Metapromote™ which is a “normal app” that allows building spaces for business promotion. 

Brands and stores can apply to join the ZEP map and will be provided with their space in the "pavilion", where they can sell their products and also use this opportunity to promote their name through posting quests for the customers and reward the most active and loyal ones. 

Users can enjoy their time by visiting various entertainment places, interact with other people and share each other their recommendations to know more about new options. They can complete quests to advance in season pass that rewards them with free coupons and other benefits offered by cafeterias. In the quests, users are offered tasks to complete such as making an Instagram post with a specific condition, unique hashtag, a brand hashtag, and their specific image must include the logo of a specific cafeteria and product which can be chosen by the businesses.

To achieve our goal and complete tasks we used the following techniques:

* ZEP script for the interaction between players and the metaverse;

* “Selenium” to get an Instagram website with a hashtag tab; 

* “Beautifulsoup” to get information;

* Requests to download the image;

* Image classification model trained on data collected from the web that can classify Starbucks and McDonald's stores and logos as an example. It is used to check quests.


Now we are working on coding stuff and combining all scripts that we are making.
